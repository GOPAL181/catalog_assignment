# Secret Sharing Interpolation

This repository contains a Node.js program that decodes secret values using Lagrange interpolation for secret sharing schemes. The secret is derived based on multiple encoded points, each having a base and value.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes bundled with Node.js)

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v


git clone https://github.com/your-repo/secret-sharing.git
cd secret-sharing


npm install


node secret-sharing.js
